### Added

- JavaDoc for parameters
- SSL SocketFactory for request context
- common gradle root build
- out/ and .gradle  to .gitignore
- pool SupervisorStrategies
- dead letters logging
- read and connect timeout to RestOperations

### Changed

- project dependencies from jar dependencies to module dependencies
- changed list-clients.xsd so that generated jaxb entities (ListClients) are XmlRootElement, 
  and xml will be validated when unmarshalling. This adds detection of such errors when listClients returns 
  non-valid message (eg. configuration outdated) and prevents problem with bad changed-timestamps. added tests.
- improved logging  
- moved example messages to src/main/doc
- Read ssl system properties from conf file
- actorSelection is no longer used for fetching actor-actor ActorRefs
- longer timeout in ApplicationConfiguration is ok since we just want to prevent complete lockups (and not hide timeouts from xroad)

### Fixed

- SSL parameter names in conf files
- fix for a task by adding if clause to FetchWsdlActor buildUri method
- incorrect ListMethods query
