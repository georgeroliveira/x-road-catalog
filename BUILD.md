## About

Developing and building the X-Road Catalog software requires an Ubuntu or a RHEL host. If you are using some other
operating system (e.g. Windows or MacOS), the easiest option is to first install Ubuntu 22.04 or RHEL7 into a virtual
machine.

**Tools**

Required for building:
* OpenJDK / JDK version 11
* Gradle
* Docker

Recommended for development environment:
* Docker
* [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/)
    * For setting up a local X-Road instance.
* Ansible
    * For automating the [X-Road ecosystem installation](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/tree/develop/ansible).

The development environment should have at least 8GB of memory and 20GB of free disk space (applies to a virtual machine
as well), especially if you set up a local X-Road ecosystem.

**Prerequisites**

* Checkout the `x-road-catalog` repository.
* The directory structure should look like this:

    ```
    - <BASE_DIR>
     |-- xroad-catalog-collector
     |-- xroad-catalog-lister
     |-- xroad-catalog-persistence
    ```
* The build scripts assumes the above directory structure.
